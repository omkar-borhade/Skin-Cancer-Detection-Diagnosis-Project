## Introduction
This project aims to develop a web-based application for the detection and diagnosis of skin cancer using deep learning techniques. The application leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification to identify potential skin cancer lesions and provide users with recommendations for nearby dermatologists.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Deployment:** (e.g., Heroku, AWS)

## Features
- Upload images of skin lesions for analysis.
- Classify images as benign or malignant.
- Provide a list of nearby dermatologists based on user location.
- Suggest precautions and next steps for the user.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-detection.git
   cd skin-cancer-detection
