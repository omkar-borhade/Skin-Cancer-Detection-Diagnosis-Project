        description: "Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. It develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin â€” the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can occur anywhere on your body, including areas not exposed to the sun. Early detection is critical, and it often starts as a change in an existing mole or a new abnormal growth.",
        causes: "Melanoma is primarily caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Family history, fair skin, and frequent sunburns also increase risk.",
        symptoms: "A new, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole. The ABCDEs of melanoma include Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variations, Diameter larger than 6mm, and Evolving in size, shape, or color.",
        treatment: "Treatment options include surgery, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.",

        causes: "Long-term exposure to UV radiation, fair skin, family history, and exposure to radiation or arsenic.",
        symptoms: "A pearly or waxy bump, a flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion, or a bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns.",
